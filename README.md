# Scientist Face Recognition Model
This is an Machine Learning Project that can recignize some sceintist face:
1. [Satyendra Nath Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose)
2. [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)
3. [Issac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) 
4. [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)

### What Framework it uses?
1. This model uses [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) framework of python.
[DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) is a lightweight face recognition framework for python.

2. [Falsk](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for backend processing. Flask is a web framework that allows developers to build lightweight web applications quickly and easily with Flask Libraries. 

### Tech Stacks used:
1. HTML
2. Flask
3. Deepface framework
